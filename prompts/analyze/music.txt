## TASK:
Analyze the provided audiobook transcription excerpt (part {part_idx}) and the fanfic description. Your goal is to suggest potential placements for background music that would enhance the atmosphere and aid the listener's immersion in the story. This is a primary creative analysis step.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  **Understand the Context:** Carefully read the `Fanfic Description` and the `Transcription Part` ({part_idx}, from {start_ms} ms to {end_ms} ms). Pay attention to the overall plot and the specific events, dialogues, and narrative tone within this excerpt.

2.  **Analyze the Text (Reasoning Phase):**
    *   Go through the `part_text` step-by-step.
    *   Identify natural narrative segments based on shifts in:
        *   **Mood/Tone:** (e.g., rising tension, calm dialogue, sudden event, sadness, joy)
        *   **Location:** (e.g., entering a new place, description of surroundings)
        *   **Pacing:** (e.g., dynamic action vs. slow description)
        *   **Key Events:** (e.g., character entrance, plot twist, important dialogue)
    *   **Explain Your Thoughts:** For each segment you identify, briefly describe why you consider it distinct, its primary mood or event. *Think aloud why music might be appropriate here.* This reasoning is important.

3.  **Suggest Music Intervals:** For segments where music seems fitting:
    *   **Timing (ms):** Determine approximate `Start` and `End` timestamps in milliseconds, using the transcription timestamps as guides for segment boundaries. Calculate the `Duration` (End - Start).
    *   **Music Character:** Describe the desired `Style/Mood` (e.g., "Mysterious ambient pad", "Light piano melody", "Tense orchestral background", "Neutral drone"). Focus on the *feeling* the music should evoke.
    *   **Intensity/Dynamics:** Suggest a relative `Intensity` (e.g., Subtle, Medium, Prominent) or dynamics (e.g., "Fades in slowly", "Fades out by the end", "Sharp accent").
    *   **Rationale:** Briefly explain (`Rationale`) why music is needed here and how the suggested character fits the context.

4.  **Format the Output:** After your analysis, provide a clear, structured list of all suggested music intervals for this part. Use the following format for each suggestion:

    ```markdown
    **Music Suggestion:**
    *   **Segment:** [Brief description, e.g., "Character enters the dark cave", "Argument between X and Y"]
    *   **Time (ms):** Start=[start_ms], End=[end_ms], Duration=[duration_ms]
    *   **Character (Style/Mood):** [e.g., Tense background]
    *   **Intensity:** [e.g., Medium, builds up]
    *   **Rationale:** [e.g., To enhance suspense during exploration]
    ```
    Ensure all timestamps are in milliseconds. Order the suggestions chronologically by their `Start` time.

## INPUT DATA:

**Fanfic Description:**
{description_content}

**Transcription (Part {part_idx}, {start_ms} ms - {end_ms} ms):**


start text
{part_text}

## EXPECTED OUTPUT:
First, provide your step-by-step reasoning about identifying segments and choosing music. Then, present the final structured list of "**Music Suggestion**" blocks.

Analyze the combined music analysis files below, which contain scene descriptions and music recommendations from multiple parts of an audiobook. Reason about them freely, then output a consolidated list of music regions with start, end, length (in milliseconds), and name. Use the Priority field (High/Medium/Low) from the analysis to prefix the name (e.g., "High: Dramatic Tension"). Format it like this:
Start,End,Length,Name
0,60000,60000,High: Calm - Exposition
60000,120000,60000,Medium: Tense - Conflict
Put the list inside triple backticks (```) like this:
```
Start,End,Length,Name
0,60000,60000,High: Calm - Exposition
```
Ensure no overlapping regions; if overlaps occur, adjust the End time of the earlier region to match the Start time of the next. Timestamps must be in milliseconds.
